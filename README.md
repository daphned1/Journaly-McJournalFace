# Journaly-McJournalFace
Many people love to write in journals for their own personal reasons. Typically, they would have their own journals to write their own thoughts down. However, there are a myriad of problems with having a physical journal. For one, it can easily get lost or forgotten by the writer. A physical journal can also be damaged by water, light, and eventually, time. One way of solving this problem is by creating a software system for personal journals. It’ll stay in the user’s safe space and stay in the database (or files) for an unlimited period of time. With an online journal, it won’t get damaged by the elements or be forgotten by the user. As of now, there are no personal applications that are both free and open-sourced. Many of the good online applications will either make you pay, have numerous ads, or steal your data. This software aims to be free, open-sourced, and be user friendly.
